=> Code Structure

-MobiusStrip class encapsulates parameters, coordinate computation, and calculations.
-Uses numpy to mesh grid the (u, v) space and apply the Möbius strip parametric equation.
-Surface area is computed using the magnitude of the cross product of partial derivatives ∂r/∂u × ∂r/∂v.
-Edge length is computed by discretizing the boundary curve at v = w/2.

=> Surface Area Approximation

-Numerical integration is used.
-The area element is approximated as:

mod|dr/du * dr/dv|dudv

-Computed this across the mesh and sum the results.


=> Challenges

-Handling mesh resolution to ensure balance between performance and accuracy.
-Avoiding numerical instability in gradient computation near wraparound edges (high resolution helps).
-Visualization can be tricky due to self-intersecting appearance — matplotlib handles it well but 3D interaction helps.
